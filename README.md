Must use Create React App CLI to make a new app

Add a Leaflet map using OSM as the basemap.

The table will be populated using JSON data in this repo. Use this as the data source for the table.

Must use RxJS to get the data as an HTTP request and must update of the table uisng an observable.

The button will be a component in each row. This button will zoom to a point contained in the data. Can use JS click event or RxJS observable.

Map, Table, and Button must be seperate React components.

This solution must be responsive.

Extra Credit - use TypeScript React
